# Movie Recommendation System
This project is a movie recommendation system. The datset used is Kaggle.com's 'Lettboxd'

# How to Run
Download the dataset files from Kaggle.com and place them in the dataset folder
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gsimonx37/letterboxd

Open a terminal in the front end directory and run 
    `python3 -m http.server`
    
Open a terminal in the back end directory and run 
    `python3 ratings_recommender.py`

Open a browser and type in 
    `localhost:8000/login.html`

 ** Please note that the back end server takes longer to load than the front end. This means the movies may not display if the back end server is still booting. **
